// this is something that you see a lot when you're first starting out

// some global constants, where you plan to put "that result stuff from the API"
const results = [];

const endpoint = new Endpoint();

console.log("starting fetch process");

  .then((response) => {
    console.log('response came back');

// ğŸ˜• This kind of thing pops up a lot. The reasoning goes something like
// this: "if I can just make JS wait long enough somehow, then the fetch
// will have time to do its thing and fill the results array"

// This is, unfortunately, very untrue. Why?

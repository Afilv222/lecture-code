// ðŸ§  Do we want ALL this JSON for our task? (what is our task again?)

// Try going to www.randyconnolly.com/funwebdev/3rd/api/travel/images.php?city=5913490
// ðŸ§  What do you notice about the JSON we get now?
// ðŸ§  What is that `city=5913490` part called? (think back to web 1 forms...)
// ðŸ§  Where did that 5913490 come from?
// ðŸ§  Where can we find a similar number for Banff?

// TODO: make a function that returns an API endpoint for a given city (but only Calgary & Banff)
// ðŸ§  What do you want to call it?

// TODO: this seems pretty useful.
// Make a constructor function for it and park it in its own file.

// OK - we've now got a way to easily figure out where the delicious JSON is.

// ðŸ§  What's our next step?

const endpoint = new Endpoint();
const fetchResult = fetch(endpoint.for("calgary"));
console.log(fetchResult);

// ðŸ§  Is `fetch` JavaScript?
// ðŸ§  What is fetch taking as its argument?
// ðŸ§  What kind of thing does fetch return, based on what we see in the console?
// ðŸ§  If you expand the Promise in the console, what do we see?
// ðŸ§  What's with the [[blahblah]]?
// ðŸ§  What's with the "pending" and the "fulfilled" and the blue i thingie?
// ðŸ§  What kind of thing is a Promise?
// ðŸ§  What properties does it have that you can access? How can you find out?
// ðŸ§  How do we get the JSON?!?

// How DO we get the JSON?

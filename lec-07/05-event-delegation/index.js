// Listen at various places
// Notice where the script tag is.

  // ðŸ§  Notice anything...interesting...about the button tags?
  // ðŸ§  What are those things?!?
  // ðŸ§  How do you get those values via JS?
  //
  // Keep this stuff in mind. We're gonna need it.
  //
  // ðŸ§  What if we wanted each button to respond to a click and log its
  //    nickname to console?
  // ðŸ§  What's one problem with this? Hint: what if there were 100 buttons?
  //
  // Build the same behaviour, but with event delegation:
  //  - try without conditional...uh-oh, Sally Mae, you rascal
  //  - use the debugger and remember when you're paused you can examine variables
  //
  // Does any of this ring a bell for the assignment?
  // (It will if you've been bored and read the pdf carefully...but I get it.)
